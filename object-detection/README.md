# Swimming pool and car detection

This is the object detection tutorial to detect the swimming pool and car using satellite imagery. 

**Note:** I exactly don't know the source of dataset. I got it from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kbhartiya83/swimming-pool-and-car-detection). The original dataset labels are generated in the `PASCAL VOC XML`, later I changed the label style to `YOLOv4 format` and uploaded to the [my kaggle account](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tekbahadurkshetri/car-and-swimming-pool-satellite-imagery).

# How to Begin?

- Click on File in the menu bar and click on Save a __copy in drive__.This will open a copy of my colab notebook on your browser which you can now use.

- Next, once you have opened the copy of my notebook and are connected to the Google Colab VM , click on __Runtime__ in the menu bar and click on __Change runtime type__. Select __GPU__ and click on save.

Now follow the following steps to get started with yolov4 object detection
