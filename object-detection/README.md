# Swimming pool and car detection

This is the object detection tutorial to detect the swimming pool and car using satellite imagery. 

## Sample prediction

Below image is the sample of the predicted image

## Dataset

I got the data from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kbhartiya83/swimming-pool-and-car-detection). The original dataset labels are generated in the `PASCAL VOC XML`, later I changed the label style to `YOLOv4 format` and uploaded to the [my kaggle account](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tekbahadurkshetri/car-and-swimming-pool-satellite-imagery).

## How to Get Start?

- Open [this notebook](https://github.com/iamtekson/satellite-imagery-deep-learning/blob/main/object-detection/Swimming_pool_and_car_detection.ipynb) in google colab

- Click on File in the menu bar and click on Save a __copy in drive__.This will open a copy of my colab notebook on your browser which you can now use.

- Next, once you have opened the copy of my notebook and are connected to the Google Colab VM , click on __Runtime__ in the menu bar and click on __Change runtime type__. Select __GPU__ and click on save.

- Other guidline is provided in the notebook itself
