1. A short introduction to the Convolution Neural Network (**CNN**)
2. Deep learning training dataset preparation guideline using **ArcGIS Pro** as well as the open source** method
3. Land Use Land Cover Classification (**image classification**)
4. Swimming pool and car detection (**object detection**)
5. Building detection (**image segmentation**)
6. Land Use Land Cover Mapping (**mult-class image segmentation**)
7. Landslide detection using the **SAR** and **Optical** dataset
8. Time series analysis with LSTM
9. End-to-end deep learning with Google Earth Engine (GEE) dataset
